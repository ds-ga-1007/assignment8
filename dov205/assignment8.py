    Program Behavior:
        This script can be run from the terminal like so:

            $ python assignment8.py

        The program will prompt you (the user) for a list of positions. Until
        the user-provided input is valid, the program will either (1) terminate
        if you provide 'q', 'quit', or 'exit' or (2) continue to prompt the user
        for valid input while demonstrating what was invalid in the most recent input.

        Next, the program will prompt you for a valid simulation count. This
        validation follows effectively the same validation schema as before: it
        will terminate if you indicate a common termination synonym, tell you
        what was incorrect about your most recent input, or continue with valid
        inputs.

        The program uses the above two components in order to perform its
        simulations. All output files are written to the local directory.

    Efficiency:
        On my machine, running the full-fledged simulation in IPython:

            %timeit simulate([1, 10, 100, 1000], 10000)

        takes approximately 2.35 seconds. I figure this is efficient enough.
        There *is* room for improvement: I believe utilizing numpy's
        broadcasting would allow us to get this done in under 2 seconds.
